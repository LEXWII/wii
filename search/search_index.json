This is more of a doomsday method than anything. I highly recommend you to buy from reputable clearnet sources as long as they are still there! This website\u2019s intention is to jumpstart you with the knowledge needed to get Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) related items over the Dark Net. Changes in the United States\u2019 leadership prompted me to make this mashup. We don\u2019t know what is to come for transgender people, but we still deserve and need this medical care. I am USA based so this information will apply to the states only, I can\u2019t guarantee it being accurate for anywhere else. This website does not sell anything or link to any specific marketplaces. This is merely an educational guide by a hobbyist. I am not a medical professional nor can I give medical advice. If you\u2019re in need of medical help, please seek a professional, not a nerd! With that all said, I\u2019d like to give another warning that as far as I know, purchasing any sort of illicit substance off of a Dark Net Marketplace (DNM) is not legal in the United States! So please do not do any of what I am about to describe.","title":"Home"}]}
